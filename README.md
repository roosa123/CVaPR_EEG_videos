**<p style="text-align: center;">A project for Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition classes at Silesian University of Technology</p>**

Lecturer: Krzysztof Kotowski  
Semester: 1st semester of the MSc studies programme

Let's determine some universal rules and project requirements (listed below):

1. Placing the dataset in the repo directory structure:  
    * let's place the dataset in the **DEAP/** directory (already only with .gitkeep file)
2. IDE
    * the suggested IDE is **PyCharm**, but let's make the project able to run from any other - just make sure you have installed proper Python packages
3. Language & libraries
    * the language of the project is **Python 3** (**important:** if you want to use TensorFlow as a backend for Keras, Python version should not be higher than **3.6**!)
    * required packages (please extend this list as you will introduce more packages):
        * Keras
        * TensorFlow
        * NumPy (probably?)

Please extend this file as any new requirements will arise!  
**That's all, folks! :)**
